# IHM-dictionary

This repository provides information on the [mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary extension 
for integrative/hybrid models. The IHM dictionary is created as an extension to existing mmCIF
dictionary used by [wwPDB](http://wwpdb.org). 

The repository is organized as follows: 

1. The "dictionary" directory has the IHM dictionary (ihm-extension.dic). Examples of integrative models
in the mmCIF format will be added soon. 

2. The "documentation" directory provides extensive documentation on the IHM dictionary, including formatted
examples spanning the various new data categories and data items created in the IHM dictionary extension.
