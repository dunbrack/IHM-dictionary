# IHM-dictionary

This repository provides information on the [mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary extension 
for integrative/hybrid models. The IHM dictionary is created as an extension to existing mmCIF
dictionary used by [wwPDB](http://wwpdb.org). 

The repository is organized as follows: 

1. The "dictionary" directory has the IHM [dictionary](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHM-dictionary/blob/master/dictionary/ihm-extension.dic). Examples of integrative models in the mmCIF format can be found on the PDB-Development, [PDB-Dev](https://pdb-dev.rcsb.rutgers.edu) website. 

2. The "documentation" directory provides extensive [documentation](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHM-dictionary/blob/master/documentation/documentation.md) on the IHM dictionary, including formatted
examples spanning the various new data categories and data items created in the IHM dictionary extension.
