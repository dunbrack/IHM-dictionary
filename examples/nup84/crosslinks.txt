Crosslinks in the model could be output as follows:

Protein1 Residue1 Protein2 Residue2 Distance Psi
Nup120   17       Nup120   421      10.0     0.05

Distance = measured distance in the model between the two residues.

Psi = uncertainty in the experimental data; it is approximately equal to
   the false positive rate. This can be optimized during the model building
   process, or held constant, and can be specified for each crosslink,
   each class of crosslink, or for all crosslinks.
   See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4151992/ for more detail.
   For Nup84 it was held constant at 5% for all crosslinks. For the
   40S-eIF1-eIF3 study (link above) the crosslinks were split into three
   groups (based on experimental confidence) and psi fixed for each one.

There is also a per-residue (at least for all crosslinked residues)
*structural* uncertainty (sigma). This is essentially, the radius of the sphere
within which the residue would have to be located in order to satisfy
the crosslink. In the Nup84 case this is constrained to be the same for *all*
residues (to reduce the number of parameters to sample).
