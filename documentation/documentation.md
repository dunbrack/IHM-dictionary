## Integrative/hybrid methods extension dictionary

### Introduction

The structures of many complex macromolecular assembles are obtained
through integrative/hybrid (I/H) methods. These methods involve a
combination of complementary methods, both experimental and computational,
that provide information on different aspects of the assembly that
can be integrated to obtain a structural view of the complex biological
machinery. The models obtained through integrative/hybrid methods
are more complex than the traditional structural models archived in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) that are obtained from a single method such as
X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or electron microscopy. We aim to
create an archive for integrative/hybrid methods and
propose to extend the existing PDBX/mmCIF dictionary to accommodate
the requirements for integrative models.
